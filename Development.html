		     <ol type = "1" style = "font-size:20px; line-height: 50px"> 
		      <li >My Persistence - I am a strong believer of "everyone has a right to their opinion" and being a rational person I like to 
			  think that my opinions are always valid, so you could say being persistent is in my nature. This trait/strength has helped me
			  quite a lot, especially when doing group assignments. I have been called stubborn and difficult but I just remind myself that
			  you will get nowhere in life being a pushover.</li>
			  <br/>
			  <li>My Confidence - Whether it was my weight or my acne, I was insecure in myself throughout high school and in the beginning 
			  of university. The smallest comments thrown at me would eat at my confidence and make me feel lesser about myself. I used my 
			  time during the covid lockdowns to work on and build myself and today I can honestly say that I am much more confident than
              I have ever been and that new found confidence has given me strength.</li>
			  <br/>
			  <li>My Love of Learning - I am the type of person who researches and reads everything once it captures my attention. I
			  also love to read so this allows me to expand my knowledge in many different subject areas.</li>
			  <br/>
			  <li>Music - Music is everything to me and I often times say that I don't know where I would be if I did not have music.
			  No matter the circumstance, I know that I will always be able to find comfort in music and that has proven to be true
			  many different times. Music makes me happy, it empowers me and it helps to ease my pain and it helps me forget, even if 
			  it does so temporarily.</li>
			  <br/>
			  <li>My Family - I like to think that my biggest strength is my family. They are my greatest support and without
			  them I don't think I would be who I am today. I spend majority of my time with family because life is short and I don't 
			  believe there is such a thing as too much family time.</li>

	   <td style = "font-size:20px; line-height: 50px;"><center><i><u>Summary</u></i></center><p style = "text-indent:50px">
	       The chapters speak on ways of making and achieving 
	       your goals. It is good to make notations of things you wish to accomplish in your life, that way you will have things to work 
		   towards with the possibility of becoming successful.It is also good to make short, medium and long term goals as it is impossible 
		   to achieve a major goal overnight after coming up with the idea.</p>
		   <p style = "text-indent:50px">Secondly, they speak on using your time wisely and making time for things such as your goals outside 
		   of working because although working to provide for your daily needs is important, it is equally as important that you make time to
		   do things that would make you happy and fulfill your life pleasures. In doing so you will have little to no regret about what you 
		   wish you had done or achieved.</p>
		   <p style = "text-indent:50px">Thirdly, they mention that it is beneficial to have people who are driven to be a better version of 
		   themselves everyday around you, because being around hard working, goal driven individuals will push you to become a better 
		   version of yourself. If you surround yourself with winners you will be motivated to become a winner as well and if you are 
		   surrounded by persons who have nothing to accomplish that type of attitude could also have an effect on you. Finally, the chapters
		   emphasize the importance of self-education and constantly developing oneself. This can be done by reading, reflecting on your
		   past experiences and observing successful individuals in your life.</p> 
		   <center><u><i>Reflection</i></u></center>
		   <p style = "text-indent:50px"> I am quite content with my life right now but after reading the chapters I can admit that some
		   self reflection needs to be done and some changes in my routine can be made. For the past two years my main focus has been on 
		   school and getting my degree. I have not been out with any friends and I hardly ever leave home so I think sooner rather than
		   later I need to make time for friends, adventures and making memories. I could also take time to write my short and long term 
		   goals as my main goal currently is getting my degree, which is only a short term goal.
